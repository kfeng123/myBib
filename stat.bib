  Abstract                 = {Linear mixed-effects models are an important class of statistical models that are used directly in many fields of applications and also are used as iterative steps in fitting other types of mixed-effects models, such as generalized linear mixed models. The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as \{EM\} iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an \{ECME\} update to refine this objective. },

To calibrate the selection procedures, we define new tuning parameter selectors based on the scores. Large-sample properties of these new tuning parameter selectors are established for the proposed procedures. These new methods are compared in simulations and a real-data application with competing methods where one ignores measurement error or uses the Bayesian information criterion to choose the tuning parameter. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This article concerns the tests for the equality of two location parameters when the data dimension is larger than the sample size. Existing spatial-sign-based procedures are not robust with respect to high dimensionality, producing tests with the type-I error rates that are much larger than the nominal levels. We develop a correction that makes the sign-based tests applicable for high-dimensional data, allowing the dimensionality to increase as the square of the sample size. We show that the proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal under elliptical distributions and demonstrate that it has good size and power in a wide range of settings by simulation. },
