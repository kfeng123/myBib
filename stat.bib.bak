  abstract  = {Linear mixed-effects models are an important class of statistical models that are used directly in many fields of applications and also are used as iterative steps in fitting other types of mixed-effects models, such as generalized linear mixed models. The parameters in these models are typically estimated by maximum likelihood or restricted maximum likelihood. In general, there is no closed-form solution for these estimates and they must be determined by iterative algorithms such as \{EM\} iterations or general nonlinear optimization. Many of the intermediate calculations for such iterations have been expressed as generalized least squares problems. We show that an alternative representation as a penalized least squares problem has many advantageous computational properties including the ability to evaluate explicitly a profiled log-likelihood or log-restricted likelihood, the gradient and Hessian of this profiled objective, and an \{ECME\} update to refine this objective. },

To calibrate the selection procedures, we define new tuning parameter selectors based on the scores. Large-sample properties of these new tuning parameter selectors are established for the proposed procedures. These new methods are compared in simulations and a real-data application with competing methods where one ignores measurement error or uses the Bayesian information criterion to choose the tuning parameter. },

  abstract  = {Abstract This article concerns the tests for the equality of two location parameters when the data dimension is larger than the sample size. Existing spatial-sign-based procedures are not robust with respect to high dimensionality, producing tests with the type-I error rates that are much larger than the nominal levels. We develop a correction that makes the sign-based tests applicable for high-dimensional data, allowing the dimensionality to increase as the square of the sample size. We show that the proposed test statistic is asymptotically normal under elliptical distributions and demonstrate that it has good size and power in a wide range of settings by simulation. },

In the last decade, rapid development has occurred in the field and many of these conditions are now known to be equivalent. We survey the subject, make the equivalences explicit, and list some groups of statistical interest which do, and also some which do not, have these properties. In particular, it is shown that the existence of the asymptotically invariant sequence of probabilities in the hypothesis of the Hunt-Stein theorem is equivalent to amenability, a condition that has been much studied by functional analysts.},

  abstract = {Summary.  We examine philosophical problems and sampling deficiencies that are associated with current Bayesian hypothesis testing methodology, paying particular attention to objective Bayes methodology. Because the prior densities that are used to define alternative hypotheses in many Bayesian tests assign non‐negligible probability to regions of the parameter space that are consistent with null hypotheses, resulting tests provide exponential accumulation of evidence in favour of true alternative hypotheses, but only sublinear accumulation of evidence in favour of true null hypotheses. Thus, it is often impossible for such tests to provide strong evidence in favour of a true null hypothesis, even when moderately large sample sizes have been obtained. We review asymptotic convergence rates of Bayes factors in testing precise null hypotheses and propose two new classes of prior densities that ameliorate the imbalance in convergence rates that is inherited by most Bayesian tests. Using members of these classes, we obtain analytic expressions for Bayes factors in linear models and derive approximations to Bayes factors in large sample settings.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel test procedure for repeated measurements based on the penalized likelihood ratio (PLR). The procedure provides an alternative to the standard likelihood ratio tests for evaluating null hypotheses concerning the correlation structure of repeated measurements. PLR tests are specifically designed for nonstandard test situations where non-identifiability of a nuisance parameter occurs under the null hypothesis. The idea is to penalize the estimation close to the boundary of the domain of the nuisance parameter and thereby eliminate the non-identifiability. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test is a 50:50 mixture of chi-square distributions with 0 and 1 degrees of freedom. Simulation studies indicate that the asymptotic distribution of the PLR test provides a good approximation, even for fairly small data sets (10--20 subjects). A sensitivity analysis with a real data example highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the test procedure.},

Three kernel functions, normal, binomial and Poisson, are used in a simulation study which illustrates the procedure.},

  abstract = {In a Bayesian analysis of finite mixture models, parameter estimation and clustering are sometimes less straightforward than might be expected. In particular, the common practice of estimating parameters by their posterior mean, and summarizing joint posterior distributions by marginal distributions, often leads to nonsensical answers. This is due to the so‐called ‘label switching’ problem, which is caused by symmetry in the likelihood of the model parameters. A frequent response to this problem is to remove the symmetry by using artificial identifiability constraints. We demonstrate that this fails in general to solve the problem, and we describe an alternative class of approaches, relabelling algorithms, which arise from attempting to minimize the posterior expected loss under a class of loss functions. We describe in detail one particularly simple and general relabelling algorithm and illustrate its success in dealing with the label switching problem on two examples.},

In univariate Bayesian linear regression with a single response y , shrinkage priors which can be expressed as scale mixtures of normalnormal densities are popular for obtaining sparse estimates of the coefficients. In this paper, we extend the use of these priors to the multivariate case to estimate a p × q coefficients matrix B . We derive sufficient conditions for posterior consistency under the Bayesian multivariate linear regression framework and prove that our method achieves posterior consistency even when p &gt; n andeven when p grows at nearly exponential rate with the sample size. We derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSP. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations and data analysis that our model has excellent finite sample performance. },

We propose to add a particular type of penalty function to the log‐likelihood function. The resulting penalized likelihood‐ratio statistics have simple limiting distributions when applied to finite mixture models with multinomial observations. The method is especially effective in addressing the problems discussed by Chernoff and Lander (1995). The theory developed and simulations conducted show that the penalized likelihood method can give very good results, better than the well‐known C(α) procedure, for example. The paper does not, however, fully explore the choice of penalty function and weight. The full potential of the new procedure is to be explored in the future.},

The problem of testing the hypothesis k=2 versusk3 is studied. There has been no general statistical testing procedure for this problem. We propose a modified likelihood ratio statistic where under the null and the alternative hypotheses the estimates of the parameters are obtained from a modified likelihood function. It is shown that estimators of the support points are consistent. The asymptotic null distribution of the modified likelihood ratio test proposed is derived and found to be relatively simple and easily applied. Simulation studies for the asymptotic modified likelihood ratio test based on finite mixture models with normal, binomial and Poisson kernels suggest that the test proposed performs well. Simulation studies are also conducted for a bootstrap method with normal kernels. An example involving foetal movement data from a medical study illustrates the testing procedure.},

The asymptotic null distribution of the likelihood ratio test (LRT) is very complex and difficult to use in practice. We propose a modified LRT for homogeneity in finite mixture models with a general parametric kernel distribution family. The modified LRT has a χ‐type of null limiting distribution and is asymptotically most powerful under local alternatives. Simulations show that it performs better than competing tests. They also reveal that the limiting distribution with some adjustment can satisfactorily approximate the quantiles of the test statistic, even for moderate sample sizes.},

  abstract = {Abstract We consider sparse Bayesian estimation in the classical multivariate linear regression model with p regressors and q response variables. In univariate Bayesian linear regression with a single response y , shrinkage priors which can be expressed as scale mixtures of normalnormal densities are popular for obtaining sparse estimates of the coefficients. In this paper, we extend the use of these priors to the multivariate case to estimate a p × q coefficients matrix B . We derive sufficient conditions for posterior consistency under the Bayesian multivariate linear regression framework and prove that our method achieves posterior consistency even when p &gt; n andeven when p grows at nearly exponential rate with the sample size. We derive an efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm and provide the implementation in a comprehensive R package called MBSP. Finally, we demonstrate through simulations and data analysis that our model has excellent finite sample performance. },
